### Update 2024



Here are eighteen datasets you can benefit from in building #machinelearning models for drug discovery, target identification, disease diagnostics and other healthcare related problems.(** Reference: https://shorturl.at/uALXY)

  
  1. TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas): molecular characterization of over 20,000 primary cancer and matched normal samples spanning 33 cancer types 
  
  2. AlphaFold DB: open access to over 200 million protein structure predictions to accelerate scientific research
  
  3. Open Targets: Integration of public domain data to enable target identification and prioritization
  
  4. ChEMBL: database of millions of molecules bringing bioactivity and genomic data to aid the translation of genomic information into effective new drugs
  
  5. TCIA (The Cancer Imaging Archive): supply of millions of de-identified and highly curated radiology and histopathology images
  
  6. DepMap: CRISPR knockout screens and genomic characterization data in cancer cell lines
  
  7. RxRx: Millions of Human cell imaging data revealing relationships across genes and chemical compounds 
  
  8. MIMIC: health data associated with thousands of intensive care unit admissions
  
  9. VinDr-CXR: more than 100,000 chest X-ray (partial annotation by radiologists)
  
  10. STRING: biological database and web resource of known and predicted protein–protein interactions
  
  11. Drugbank: database containing information on drugs and drug targets
  
  12. VirHostNet: database of virus-virus, virus-host and host-host interaction networks coupled to their functional annotations
  
  13. PeptideAtlas: multi-organism, publicly accessible compendium of peptides identified in a large set of tandem mass spectrometry proteomics experiments.
  
  14. Uniprot: high-quality, comprehensive and freely accessible resource of protein sequence and functional information
  
  15. PDB (Protein Data Bank): 3D structure data for large biological molecules (proteins, DNA, and RNA)
  
  16. MMHCdb (Mouse Models of Human Cancer Database): expertly curated resource of diverse mouse models of human cancer
  
  17. PCAWG (Pancancer Analysis of Whole Genomes): more than 2,600 cancer whole genomes from the International Cancer Genome Consortium
  
  18. Single cell expression atlas: Expression data of millions of cells across different species
